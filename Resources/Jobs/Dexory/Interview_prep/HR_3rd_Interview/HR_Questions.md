Absolutely — and this is a **smart moment** to get this right.
Below is **your original list**, but rewritten with **clear, senior-level phrasing** and **explicit salary + equity questions** that won’t sound pushy or premature.

You can use this almost verbatim in the HR round.

---

## Ways of Working

**Work from home / hybrid**

* “How often is office presence expected in practice?”
* “Is there flexibility around core hours? I need to accommodate school drop-off and pick-up.”
* “Given I’m based in Edinburgh, how future-proof is the current hybrid/remote approach?”
* “When office attendance is required, how are travel and accommodation handled?”

**Work abroad**

* “Are there any constraints around occasional remote working from abroad for short periods?”

---

## Equipment & Setup

* “What equipment does Dexory typically provide — laptop, OS choice, peripherals?”
* “Is there flexibility around operating system choice depending on role?”

---

## Compensation & Long-Term Incentives

**Salary**

* “Could you share the expected salary range for this role?”
* “How are salary reviews and progression handled over time?”
* “Is there a structured review cycle, or is progression more performance-driven?”

**Bonus**

* “Is there a bonus component to the role, and how is that typically structured?”

**Pension**

* “Is the pension offered via salary exchange?”
* “If I increase my pension contributions, are employee National Insurance savings passed on?”
* “Is pension contribution limited to the Dexory scheme, or can contributions be made to a personal SIPP?”

**Equity / Share Options**

* “Is equity or share options part of the overall compensation package for this role?”
* “If so, how is that typically structured — vesting period, review points, and how Dexory thinks about equity for senior hires?”

(You don’t need to ask about valuation or exit yet — that can come later if equity is confirmed.)

---

## Benefits & Development

* “What does the training and conference budget typically look like in practice?”
* “How does Dexory support ongoing professional development?”

---

## Strong closing line (use this)

> “I’m keen to make sure I fully understand the total reward and ways of working so that, if we move forward, it’s a sustainable and long-term fit on both sides.”

This framing:

* Signals commitment
* Invites transparency
* Keeps the tone collaborative, not transactional

---

### Final coaching note (important)

If HR responds with:

> “We’ll discuss salary later”

Your calm follow-up should be:

> “That’s fine — it would just be helpful to understand whether the role is broadly aligned with my current level, given the change in pension structure.”

That keeps you **in control** without being confrontational.

If you want, next I can:

* Help you define **your walk-away and stretch numbers**
* Prep answers if they challenge pension expectations
* Help you interpret equity language when they describe it

You’re handling this exactly as a senior hire should.
