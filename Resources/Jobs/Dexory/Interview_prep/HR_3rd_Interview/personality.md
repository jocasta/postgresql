## Conscientiousness
You are an exceptionally conscientious person, who is very considerate about the quality of the work that you produce. You will invest a lot of time and consideration into your work, which may lead others to perceive you as perfectionistic. Due to your high standards, delegating tasks may be challenging for you. You are likely to believe that by doing it yourself, you can ensure a job is done correctly. You may find team environments where other people do not share your work ethic challenging. You are extremely self-motivated and set challenging goals and targets for yourself. You are always eager to achieve and strive for success in everything you do.

Here are some development tips that you may find helpful:

* Due to being very focused on standards and achievement, you may come across as very serious or strict. When working with others, balance your high levels of task orientation with emotive language, humour or spontaneity.
* Try to avoid excessive self-criticism or fault-finding tendencies. Instead, focus on celebrating your successes, as well as those of others.
* Setting realistic standards and deadlines can help to prevent you from spending too much time perfecting things, which could be demotivating for others.
* Your tendency towards perfectionism in your work can cause hesitancy when it comes to sharing responsibilities and delegating tasks. More can be achieved when people work together, so try determining which tasks others can assist with and find ways to communicate this in an empowering way.

## Adjustment
You are exceptionally composed, even under extreme pressure, only rarely showing signs of stress or negative emotions. Although you will experience these feelings at times, you will find it easy to remain focused and will not entertain negative emotions for long. Compared to most people, you are confident in your work and self-assured in your ability to overcome setbacks. At times, you may get frustrated with people who become stressed more easily and you will probably dislike emotionally volatile people. When you are experiencing stress, it is important to tell others, as your composed nature may make it hard for them to know how you are really feeling. Your calm and collected demeanour gives people confidence during challenging times and you are likely perceived by others as being extremely reliable in a crisis. On the other hand, you may find that your extremely calm exterior can be viewed by others as indifferent, aloof, or unapproachable.

Here are some development tips that you may find helpful:

* Making time to check in and listen to the emotions and concerns of others can help you to show understanding towards them.
* Learning to communicate your thoughts and feelings with others (especially during difficult times) can help you to avoid appearing distant and aloof.
* Prioritising your tasks in terms of urgency and importance can help you focus on the most relevant tasks first.

## Curiosity
You strike a balance between exploring new ideas and relying on tried and tested methods. Your approach to work may be conventional at times, but you will be open to new proposals about how to get something done. It is likely that you will find several different topics interesting while retaining a core set of interests to which you dedicate most of your time. You will generally enjoy learning new things and being exposed to different ideas, approaches, and perspectives. However, you may not change your own style unless presented with strong arguments and supporting evidence. You may prefer to take your time thinking through the connections between something new and a topic you already know before making the decision to adopt a novel approach. This will help you evaluate new ideas rationally, rather than embracing change for the sake of it.

Here are some development tips that you may find helpful:

* You may benefit from spending time with colleagues who have differing appetites for novelty in order to gain insight into different approaches to problems.
* Consider challenging yourself to test new ideas rather than relying on the tried and tested approaches.
* When you feel inclined to discard a proposed change or new idea, be sure to consider its advantages before returning to the standard way of doing things.

## Risk Approach
You will generally feel comfortable with confronting someone, preferring to do it sooner rather than later. You are unlikely to be the most assertive person in a group but will defend your point of view if you believe it is important. At times, you may back down if a discussion becomes too heated and confrontational. You will calculate when it is best to challenge, and when it is best to leave things for another day. However, you will likely find that proactively dealing with problems can prevent them from worsening. It can be beneficial to avoid delaying difficult conversations by approaching them tactfully.

Here are some development tips that you may find helpful:

* During difficult conversations, taking note of others’ emotional cues can help you identify when to be more cautious or diplomatic.
* Discover appropriate ways for asserting yourself during confrontations, to ensure that you communicate your point of view effectively.
* Challenge yourself to deal proactively with problems and issues. Anticipate when difficult conversations are required and prepare yourself by planning how you will articulate or defend your views.

## Ambiguity Acceptance
You generally prefer environments that are stable, structured, and predictable. When you do face ambiguity, you will probably ask for clarity to make sure you know what is expected of you. You may prefer that people keep things simple and gave you clear, yes or no answers. It is likely that you work best when you have clear tasks, objectives, and processes to follow. In rare circumstances, you may appreciate more freedom to determine how you go about meeting tasks and objectives. Although you may prefer clarity, you will be able to manage ambiguity with some organising and planning.

Here are some development tips that you may find helpful:

* Take opportunities to discuss vague and complex information with different people, as this can enhance your understanding of a situation or project.
* Applying analytical thinking strategies, such as considering the detail and practical solutions, can help you make sense of ambiguous information.
* Following clear processes can assist you with making complex decisions. Always ensure that you keep the desired outcome or main goals in mind when considering all the information.

## Competitiveness
You are not particularly competitive and probably find very competitive environments counterproductive. You may view competition as unnecessary, especially in a group situation, where collaboration is key. What you think of your own performance will be more important to you than comparisons with other people. Although you will not need excessive praise and rewards, you do like to be recognised for your accomplishments and contribution to the team. You will enjoy being part of a successful team and want everyone's contributions to be recognised. You will enjoy seeing your friends and colleagues succeed, rarely experiencing jealousy about the achievements of others. Your approach makes you a considerate team player who wants everyone to succeed together.

Here are some development tips that you may find helpful:

* Be aware that your easy-going and accommodating nature could be misunderstood as a lack of ambition or enthusiasm for your work.
* Speak up when you have ideas to contribute.
* It can be helpful to consider how those with a higher competitive drive than you contribute to the working environment. By understanding and appreciating what they offer, you are less likely to take their behaviour personally and be intimidated, offended, or hurt by their actions.
