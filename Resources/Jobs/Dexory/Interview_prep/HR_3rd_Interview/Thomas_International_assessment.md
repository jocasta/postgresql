# 1. Deadlines slipping

They will ask this.

Good answer:

* You surface issues early

* You offer options, not excuses

* You communicate impact, not panic

“If a deadline is at risk, I flag it early with options — reduce scope, extend timeline, or accept risk — so it becomes a decision, not a surprise.”

# 2. Startup vs enterprise mindset

You should not pretend you’re reckless.

Say:

* You know when “perfect” blocks progress

* But you don’t compromise on data integrity or safety

* That’s exactly right for robotics.

# 3. Motivation

They will test whether this is “just a job”.

Have a crisp answer:

Impact

Scale

Physical-world data

Ownership

Not salary. Not tech toys.

## Smart questions to ask HR (this scores points)

Use this round to ask grown-up questions:

* How do Dexory support people when priorities shift suddenly?”

* What behaviours distinguish high performers here?”

* How does Dexory balance speed with reliability in production systems?”

* How do engineering and robotics teams collaborate day to day?”


These show:

You’re evaluating them

You understand startup realities

You think long-term

* Architectural design for Pipeline deployment - they disagreed with the security position

## (2) A time you adapted plans under time pressure

* Planned Production deployment requirement changed on the day of deployment - CMS 

## (3) A time you balanced speed vs correctness
