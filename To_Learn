### Crunchy Data Official Resources

Crunchy Data — the company behind Crunchy Bridge — publishes free tutorials and interactive Postgres exercises covering topics from basic SQL to advanced features and performance patterns:
* ✔ Guided Postgres exercises in your browser (Postgres Playground) — hands-on SQL practice without installing anything.
* ✔ A wide range of deeper blog tutorials covering RLS, window functions, backup strategies, etc. (good for stay-sharp reading)

These are practical ways to stay sharp even if you’re familiar with everyday Postgres usage.

### 📌 Crunchy Bridge Documentation

Spend some time with the Crunchy Bridge docs and walkthroughs — things like how they handle:

* Automated backups & restores

* High availability and failover

* Connection pooling

* Monitoring & metrics
These docs are the operational side of working with a managed Postgres platform and often include best practices that differ slightly from self-managed instances.


## ⚙️ Hands-On / Practical Projects

Especially as someone moving into a new platform, nothing beats experience:

### ✔ Set Up a Crunchy Bridge Test Cluster

* Deploy a basic instance in AWS/Azure/GCP.
* Connect with your usual tooling (`psql`, DBeaver, etc.).
* Practice migrations from a local Postgres instance onto Bridge.
* Experiment with backups, PITR, read replicas, scaling.

### ✔ Build Performance Scenarios

Use tools like:

* `pgbench` for benchmarking
* `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` for query performance inspection
* pg_stat views to understand workload behaviour

These general Postgres skills pay dividends across any managed Postgres platform.

## 🚀 Practical Tips for Your Transition

✔ **Cloud mindset over engine differences:** Crunchy Bridge’s value is in automation, reliability, and tooling — the core SQL and engine behaviour is still Postgres.
✔ **Understand provider quirks:** Compare how Bridge handles auth/roles, backups, and scaling versus your Aurora experience.
✔ **Join the community:** Crunchy Data has tutorials, Slack/Discord communities, and blog posts that keep you connected to real use-cases and patterns. ([Crunchy Data][4])

## 🧠 Final Recommendation

Focus on **deep Postgres internals and performance books** *and* complement them with **Crunchy Bridge-specific docs and tutorials**. The books will give you long-term mastery; Bridge content will help you apply that mastery in your new organisation’s stack.

If you want, I can also pull together a tailored learning path (e.g., beginner → intermediate → advanced milestones), including free resources and certification/course suggestions.
